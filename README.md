[Photos.network](https://photos.network) is an open source project for self hosted photo management.
Its core features are:

- Keep track of your photos with privacy
- Share photos and albums with friends, family or public
- Search for photos by attributes like location or objects

## App

The Android app itself is self-sufficient and can be used to browse local photos on a device, add tags or search by attributes.
When the app is connected to a [core instance](https://github.com/photos-network/core) the feature set increases like sharing images via link.

## Core
A [core instance](https://github.com/photos-network/core) can run additional long-running tasks to analyze, categorize or group photos based
on all data gained from the photos added.
