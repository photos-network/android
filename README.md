## App

The Android app itself is self-sufficient and can be used to browse local photos on an android device, add tags or search by attributes.
When the app is connected to a [photos.network server](https://github.com/photos-network/core) the feature set increases like sharing images via link.

## Server
A [photos.network server](https://github.com/photos-network/core) can run additional long-running tasks to analyze, categorize or group photos based
on all data gained from the uploaded photos.
